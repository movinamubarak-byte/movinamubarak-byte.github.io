npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.

## Environment Variables

This project requires Supabase environment variables to function:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Supabase anon/public key

### Local Development

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

   **Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored and will NOT be committed to the repository (this is correct for security).

### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add the following repository secrets:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
